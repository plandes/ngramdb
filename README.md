# Create an SQLite database from the Google ngrams database.

[![Travis CI Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-link]
[![PyPI][pypi-badge]][pypi-link]

Creates an SQLite database of the one million [n-gram] datasets from Google.
This code downloads the [n-gram data sets] corpus and then creates an [SQLite]
database file with the contents.  It also provides a simple API for [n-gram]
look ups.

## Installation

1. To make life easier, install [GNU Make].  If you do not, you'll need to
   follow the steps given in the [makefile](./makefile).
2. Download the 1 million [n-gram data sets]: `make download`.  This should
   take a few minutes with a good Internet connection.
3. Un-compress the load files: `make uncompress`.
4. Create and load the [SQLite] database from the downloaded corpus: `make
   load`.  Depending on the processor speed, this should take about an hour and
   creates a file in `data/eng-1gram.db` that takes 18G on disk.
5. Install from the command line either from source (`make install`) or from
   [pip](#obtaining).

If you want to use the program on the command line (as opposed to an API),
create a the following file in `~/.ngramdbrc` with the contents:
```ini
[default]
[ngram_db]
data_dir=${HOME}/path/to/eng-1gram.db
```

### Data Size

As mentioned, the [SQLite] database file take 18G on disk.  This is because it
keeps occurrences over several decades.  In many cases, older n-grams are not
needed and queries can take a while given the size of the data.  The data can
be minimized with the following SQL in any [SQLite] interface (i.e. MacOS has
`sqlite3` on the command line):
```sql
delete from ngram where yr < 1990;
```
In this example, all n-grams recorded from publications before the year 1990
are expunged.


## Usage

This project can be used either from the command line or as an API.


### Command Line

To use from the command line:
```bash
% ngramdb query -g the -y 2005
631362690 0.56880%
```
This gives the number of unigrams (assuming unigrams were built) found since
2005 and the percentage of that unigram to all words in the corpus.


### Programmatic Interface

As in the [installation](#installation) section, create the `~/.ngramdbrc`
configuration file.  Also note that the API is configured to easily work with
other Python projects that use the [zensols.actioncli] configuration API.

```python
from zensols.ngramdb import AppConfig, Query
conf = AppConfig.instance().app_config
query = Query(conf)
stash = query.stash
n_occurs = stash['The']
print(f'{n_occurs} {100 * n_occurs / len(stash):.5f}%')

=> 631362690 0.56880%
```


### Data Analysis with Pandas

The [stash access](#programmatic-interface) is nice for specific use cases
where a subset of the corpus counts are necessary.  However, the intention of
creating a selectable data format was to allow for data analysis as well.
Here's an example of how [Pandas] can be used directly against the created
[SQLite] file learn about the corpus:
```python
from zensols.actioncli.time import time
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3 as s

# "connect" to the SQLite database file
db = '/path/to/data/directory/eng-1gram.db'
conn = s.connect(db)

# create a dataframe with all entries on or after 1990
sql = 'select grams, match_count as cnt from ngram where yr >= 1990'
with time('{rc} rows read'):
    df = pd.read_sql_query(sql, conn)
    rc = len(df)
#=> 28150989 rows read finished in 60.8s

# create a data frame with a ngram text and number of match counts per row
with time('groupby of {rc} rows'):
    dfg = df.groupby(['grams'], as_index=False).agg({'cnt': 'sum'})
    rc = len(df)
#=> group of 28150989 rows finished in 7.6s

# get the number of counts on 'the'
dfg[dfg['grams'] == 'the']
#=>         grams        cnt
#=> 2819462   the  621594750

# all token occurrences
all_cnt = df['cnt'].sum()
all_cnt
#=> 13269089201

# calculate at the poulation of a few words
for word in 'the The . cat dog phone iPhone'.split():
	occ = dfg[dfg['grams'] == word].cnt.item()
	pop = occ / all_cnt
	print(f'word \'{word}\' found {occ} times, which is {pop * 100:.5f}% of the corpus')

#=> word 'the' found 621594750 times, which is 4.68453% of the corpus
#=> word 'The' found 77576794 times, which is 0.58464% of the corpus
#=> word '.' found 641792317 times, which is 4.83675% of the corpus
#=> word 'cat' found 247075 times, which is 0.00186% of the corpus
#=> word 'dog' found 453789 times, which is 0.00342% of the corpus
#=> word 'phone' found 522190 times, which is 0.00394% of the corpus
#=> word 'iPhone' found 178 times, which is 0.00000% of the corpus

with time('pickled data frame'):
    df.to_pickle('df.dat')
#=> pickled data frame finished in 8.0s

with time('write to csv'):
    df.to_csv('df.csv')
#=> write to csv finished in 44.3s

with time('read data from'):
    df = pd.read_pickle('df.dat')
#=> read data from finished in 2.4s
```


## Obtaining

The easist way to install the command line program is via the `pip` installer:
```bash
pip3 install zensols.ngramdb
```

Binaries are also available on [pypi].
